The Adaptive Traffic Signal System is an intelligent traffic control project designed to optimize traffic flow using an 8052 microcontroller. This system dynamically manages traffic signals based on real-time vehicle detection, ensuring efficient traffic regulation at intersections. The project utilizes sensors to monitor vehicle density on four lanes and employs external interrupts to update lane-specific vehicle counts. The system then adjusts the green light duration for each lane accordingly, prioritizing lanes with higher traffic. An LCD display provides real-time updates, showing the active lane and corresponding vehicle counts while signaling messages such as "LANE-1 GO." The system operates in a cyclic manner, sequentially activating signals for each lane while resetting counters after each cycle. By combining modular code, timer-based signal management, and real-time data display, the project showcases an effective prototype for smart city infrastructure. Its scalability and potential for IoT integration make it a foundation for advanced traffic solutions, reducing congestion, improving flow, and promoting sustainable urban transportation.
