# Traffic-Signal-System-using-an-8052-microcontroller
This project implements an Adaptive Traffic Signal System using an 8051 microcontroller to dynamically manage traffic flow based on real-time vehicle detection. The system ensures efficient traffic management by monitoring vehicle counts at each lane and adjusting signal durations accordingly.
